### What it does
The mobile application has multiple features ranging from menial tasks to AI-supported creative tasks:

**1. Voice Cloning of a Parent and Storytelling/Lullaby**

One of the creative features of the mobile application is cloning the voice of the parent through LMNT, and voicing the stories or lullabies that are created by OpenAI. Even when the parent is away or on a business occasion, the baby can hear their voices telling stories, eventually helping them calm down.

**2. Educational Article Search**

Based on the user's activity within the app, we use You.com to make educative articles accessible and give them personalized recommendations on educative materials that they can read with the click of a button. This feature is especially important since first-time parents want to learn, but they do not necessarily have the time, community, and resources to look out for information. 

**3. Emotional Journaling for the Parents**

With audio recordings evaluated by Hume.ai, we track parents' emotional conditions and their progress day by day. This is especially important after the birth to track the emotional progression of the mom, or to realize trends in the parents' emotional cycle when the baby is added to the family. We also provide an emotional dashboard for the current day.

**4. Personalized Assistant**

We created a specialized agent for the users that focuses on baby care. We personalized this assistant to be empathetic, understanding, and easy to understand for the parents. Using OpenAI, this agent aims to provide quick fixes, advice, and assistance in a customizable fashion when the parent has a scenario-based problem that requires contextual understanding.

**5. Information Sheets, Updates, Tasks, Events and Scheduling**

Though very primitive (since we did not have enough time to make them look fancy), we do small tasks such as adding tasks, and events, listing out other events, scheduling etc. We also list the information about the baby for tracking purposes. Mainly to give all the tools that a parent needs to them before closing the app.
